# To print this file in a descent format, click the "Raw" button in the top right corner of this box.
# Disclaimer: Im no way a Linux or Arch Linux pro user, ive just written down what i did to make it work for me.


# A good place to read up on most if not all of this stuff is the Arch wiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/).
# Else a quick google search can get you a long way


# Make a bootable device(USB, CD/DVD etc.) with archlinux iso (https://www.archlinux.org/download/).
# You can do that with Rufus on windows (its free), or if using Ubuntu follow these instructions (https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu).
# Else you run the following command or something similar (Maybe even google it?).

# replace then anglebrackets <something> with the appropiate path.
sudo dd bs=4M if=<path to iso file> of=<path to device> && sync

# Then boot into your install media (USB, CD/DVD etc.) by rebooting and at the begging of the startup process hit F9 (or whatever F# button that opens the bootmenu).
# If its booted correctly into the bootmedia, it should greet you with Arch Linux menu and the following options
    # "Boot Arch Linux (x86_64)" (Choose this if you want a 64 bit Arch installation). 
           #(|__if this option is not avaible you properly not able to install 64 bit on your machine)
    # "Boot Arch Linux (i686)" (Choose this if you want a 32 bit Arch installation).
    # "Boot existing OS"
    # "Run Memtest86+ (Ram test)"
    # "Hardware Information"
    # "Reboot"
    # "Power Off"

# You can navigate the menu with the arrow keys and click enter to choose the option
# For these notes i will be installing x86_64 Arch
# After choosing 64 or 32 bit arch will do its thing for a while and when its ready it will greet you with the following:
    # "Arch Linux "(version number)"
    # "archiso login: root (automatic login)
    # "root@archiso ~ #"

# This means you have a root prompt ready for use. Be warned you can potentionaly destroy all data on your disks which i will do during the partioning. You can also follow my partioning with ubuntu installed there i will keep my ubuntu data for dual boot.


# First thing to is remove the anoying beeb sound when ever you tab-complete or try to tab-complete a command. (or doing something the terminal doesnt like in general)
setterm -blength 0
-------------------------------> Is setterm permantly or temporary <-------------------------------


# Second thing to do is load the correct keymap (The standard is US)

# replace DK with yours country's letter (eg. dk for denmark, uk for united kingdom, us for united states, es for spain)
loadkeys <country letters goes here>
# This command is only temporary, that means after restart it will be back at US

# To list all avaible keymaps do the following 
find /usr/share/kbd/keymaps | less

# Or to find only those with your country letters. (this finds all files in keymaps that contains <your country letters>)
find /usr/share/kbd/keymaps | grep -i <country letters go here>
# You will propally see something like this
    # "/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/dk-latin1.map.gz
    # "/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/dk.map.gz
    # "/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/mac-dk-latin1.map.gz
    
# For more information on "nodeadkeys" look here (http://askubuntu.com/questions/56560/what-exactly-is-meant-by-eliminate-dead-keys)
# I dont know the difference between "dk-latin1" and "dk", so just try one or other and test the layout byt typing speciel characters. if the wrong character comes try another keymap.

# To set current keymap, and to make it permantly do the following:
localectl set-keymap --no-convert <insert keymap file>


# Next up is to check your internet connection (I recommend that you use a Ethernet connection ie. a cable connection)
ping google.dk
# You can allways swap out google with a site you know that you can reach. the site have to be on the World Wide Web (ie, www)
# If you get "Name or service not know" you either typed the site wrong or you got no connection


# To check the time of the system type:
timedatectl
# This should show you a date and a clock, plus some more stuff
# to make sure the clock is accurate do this:
timedatectl set-ntp true


# Now is the time for disk Format and pationing
# There is a handfull of tools and commands avaiable ill only be using some of them. You check the list here (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning#Partitioning_tools)
# To list file systems and disks:
lsblk -f -p
# This should show something like this:
    # "NAME         FSTYPE      LABEL       UUID
    # "/dev/sdb                                                                                                 "
    # "└─/dev/sdb1  vfat        ARCH_201701 1702-0227                               /run/archiso/bootmnt        "
    # "/dev/sr0                                                                                                 "
    # "/dev/loop0   squashfs                                                        /run/archiso/sfs/airootfs   "
    # "/dev/sda                                                                                                 "
    # "└─/dev/sda1  ext4                    f2b67d75-090a-4d96-8dfb-e814dd07fd13                                "

# The "/dev/sdb" is my pc disk with my previous Arch Linux installation while the "/dev/sda" is my bootable usb-disk, where the Arch is image is placed.
# Disk name in linux are named after the alfabet, so sd*(where * is the next letter in the alfabet). (eg. sda for the first disk, sdb for the secound disk, sdc for the third disk etc.)
# The secound line "└─/dev/sdb1" is a partion of disk "sdb" so partions are named after number (eg. sdb1, sdb2, sdb3)
# You should just ignore "/dev/sr0", "/dev/loop0" and your bootmedia (in my case /dev/sda). All of these are used by the bootmedia.
