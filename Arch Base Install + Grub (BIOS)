# To print this file in a descent format, click the "Raw" button in the top right corner of this box.
# Disclaimer: Im no way a Linux or Arch Linux pro user, ive just written down what i did to make it work for me.


# Make a bootable device(USB, CD/DVD etc.) with archlinux iso (https://www.archlinux.org/download/).
# You can do that with Rufus on windows (its free), or if using Ubuntu follow these instructions (https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu).
# Else you run the following command or something similar (Maybe even google it?).

# replace then anglebrackets <something> with the appropiate path.
sudo dd bs=4M if=<path to iso file> of=<path to device> && sync

# Then boot into your install media (USB, CD/DVD etc.) by rebooting and at the begging of the startup process hit F9 (or whatever F# button that opens the bootmenu).
# If its booted correctly into the bootmedia, it should greet you with Arch Linux menu and the following options
    # "Boot Arch Linux (x86_64)" (Choose this if you want a 64 bit Arch installation). 
           #(|__if this option is not avaible you properly not able to install 64 bit on your machine)
    # "Boot Arch Linux (i686)" (Choose this if you want a 32 bit Arch installation).
    # "Boot existing OS"
    # "Run Memtest86+ (Ram test)"
    # "Hardware Information"
    # "Reboot"
    # "Power Off"

# You can navigate the menu with the arrow keys and click enter to choose the option
# For these notes i will be installing x86_64 Arch
# After choosing 64 or 32 bit arch will do its thing for a while and when its ready it will greet you with the following:
    # "Arch Linux "(version number)"
    # "archiso login: root (automatic login)
    # "root@archiso ~ #"

# This means you have a root prompt ready for use. Be warned you can potentionaly destroy all data on your disks which i will do during the partioning. You can also follow my partioning with ubuntu installed there i will keep my ubuntu data for dual boot.


# First thing to is remove the anoying beeb sound when ever you tab-complete or try to tab-complete a command. (or doing something the terminal doesnt like in general)
setterm -blength 0
-------------------------------> Is setterm permantly or temporary <-------------------------------


# Second thing to do is load the correct keymap (The standard is US)

# replace DK with yours country's letter (eg. dk for denmark, uk for united kingdom, us for united states, es for spain)
loadkeys <country letters goes here>
# This command is only temporary, that means after restart it will be back at US

# To list all avaible keymaps do the following (you need the keymaps for making the change permanent)
find /usr/share/kbd/keymaps | less
# Or to find only those with your country letters. (this finds all files in keymaps that contains <your country letters>)
find /usr/share/kbd/keymaps | grep -i <country letters go here>
