# Make a bootable device(USB, CD/DVD etc.) with archlinux iso (https://www.archlinux.org/download/).
# You can do that with Rufus on windows (its free), or if using Ubuntu follow these instructions (https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu).
# Else you run the following command or something similar (Maybe even google it?).

# replace then anglebrackets <something> with the appropiate path.
sudo dd bs=4M if=<path to iso file> of=<path to device> && sync

# Then boot into your install media (USB, CD/DVD etc.) by rebooting and at the begging of the startup process hit F9 (or what ever F# button that opens the bootmenu).
